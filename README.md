# Trillo
Trillo is a fictional company for booking hotels flights and cars.

The website is a landing page for the company,built as part of advance css and sass course.
In the site I've implemented all the advance techniques from the course and more!
In addition, I've added some Javascript to create more authentic feel to the app (mainly with the messages).
